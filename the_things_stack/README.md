# The Things Stack

This Python module gets information about an application on [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and retrieves the necessary metadata for use in [Urban Flows Observatory](https://urbanflows.ac.uk/).

It uses the Software Development Kit (SDK) provided the The Things Stack gRPC APIs, specifically the [Application Manager API](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/manager/). See docs: [Build applications on The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/).
